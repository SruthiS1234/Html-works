        <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
        <p class="parag-1">HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. 
            HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how 
            to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", 
            "this is a link", etc.</p>

            <p class="para-3">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

                HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
                
                Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response 
                to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the 
                requested content.</p>
